                <p>
                    This website was designed as a part of a PHP academic project to demonstrate web development skills 
                    and showcase the power of PHP in building dynamic web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to make PHP concepts easier to learn through structured theory, simple explanations, 
                    and executable programs with real outputs.
