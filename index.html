            <h1>Introduction to PHP</h1>
            <p><b>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)</b> is an open-source, server-side scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It can be embedded directly within HTML and connects easily with databases like MySQL, making it ideal for developing complete web applications.</p>

            <p>PHP is known for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility. It runs on various platforms and supports multiple databases, helping developers build interactive websites, manage user data, and perform backend operations with ease.</p>
